### Commments on Zhu Tong’s Interpretations

A good interpreter must have encyclopedic knowledge. Let’s take a look at Zhu Tong’s interpretation on some specific word like tsar and Gorbarchev. She must be familiar with the history of Russia and the current politics so that she can translate fluently.

The other example is the question raised by Phoenix Hong Kong, it is a very long and complex question. It is quite difficult for one person to remember in his mother language, but a good interpreter can not only remember them but also think how to translate them into the target language. I think it requests 100 percent of concentration and an outstanding memory.

I also find that Zhu Tong has a terrific command of language as well as her articulation. She pronounces well , at the same time she has a good sense of hearing so she can clearly hear what people ask.
